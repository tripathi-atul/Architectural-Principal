There are 5 architectural principal for system design:

1) Solid Principals(single responsibility, open/closed principals,Liskov Substitution,Interface Segregation,Dependency Inversion Principal)
2) Principals of least astonishment(changes should be in line so that knowledgable person learning curve is not tough(should not be surprised), he should be able to learn on its own)
3) Principal of least effort(We should take strong decision in start of design so that developers has to just follow the design and put their codes in)
4) Principal of Opportunity cost (tradeoff between benefit and cost)
5) Principal of last responsible moment(cost of delay)
